### Description

The REST API I watched from a [YouTube](https://youtu.be/tvKhOAlAjTY?si=Go7KOjeKUx6sXGhf) video and learned new things from it. I had done a similar [project before](https://github.com/AshkanHagh/Express-Twitter-Clone-API) with my own knowledge, which I thought turned out pretty well even though I hadn't seen a video.
